Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the array is monotonic.

An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, left to right , are entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.

Non-increasing elements aren't neccessarily exclusively decreasing; they simply don't increase. Similarly, non-decreasing elements aren't exclusively increasing; they simply don't decrease.

Note that empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.

Input:

array = [-3,-5,-15,-500,-500,-700,-703,-1001]

Ouput:
true
